Brilliantly written dive into everything \TeX{} has to offer, by none other than
its creator. The exposition includes great amounts of detail, while remaining
relatively light to read, given the complexity of the tackled topic.

Might not be useful as a reference, given that it is written to accommodate
cover-to-cover reading, and information is scattered throughout. Reading
multiple times is recommended.
