Here is the definitive guide to the use of \TeX, written by the system's
creator, Donald E. Knuth. \TeX{} represents the state of the art in computer
typesetting. It is particularly valuable where the document, article, or book to
be produced contains a lot of mathematics, and where the user is concerned about
typographic quality. \TeX~software offers both writers and publishers the
opportunity to produce technical text of all kinds, in an attractive form, with
the speed and efficiency of a computer system. Novice and expert users alike
will gain from The \TeX{}book the level of information they seek. Knuth warns
newcomers away from the more difficult areas, while he entices experienced users
with new challenges. The novice need not learn much about \TeX{} to prepare a
simple manuscript with it. But for the preparation of more complex documents,
The \TeX{}book contains all the detail required. Knuth's familiar wit, and
illustrations specially drawn by Duane Bibby, add a light touch to an unusually
readable software manual.
